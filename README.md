# Project Tracking
This project was a development challenge from Frontend Mentor. They gave me the style guide, the design and I had to create the website from there. I used HTML and CSS for the bulk of this project. The responsive menu with animated open and close buttons was created using JavaScript and I used Googleâ€™s Material Design icons.
